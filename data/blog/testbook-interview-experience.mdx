## Interview Rounds

Testbook's process started around the second week of August. The complete process was divided into three rounds:

1. Aptitude Test
2. Technical Interview - I
3. Technical Interview - II

## Aptitude Test

This test was conducted on [testbook.com](http://testbook.com) itself. The test was of 70 marks and had different sections - quantitative aptitude, logical reasoning, verbal ability & programming. The questions were fairly easy and the only challenge was to attempt all the questions in time. 115 students attempted this round and 47 were shortlisted for further interviews.

## Technical Interview - I

The interview started with introductions from both sides. The interviewer was very polite and ‚Äúchill‚Äù. After the intro, we discussed the projects and internships in detail. The interviewer had a lot of interest in my internship project and the whole idea of the startup which I worked with.

Then we moved to DSA questions:

- What's your favorite data structure and why? (I answered Linked List)
- Real life application of linked lists.
- When and where have you used linked lists during your internship?

After these quick questions he asked me to solve a question on google sheet and also to write working code (not just pseudo-code) of the same in any language of my preference.

- Maximum product of a triplet in an array.

[Maximum product of a triplet (subsequence of size 3) in array - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-maximum-product-of-a-triplet-in-array/)

I was able to solve the question using brute-force and also optimize it. I wrote the code for the best approach and he was satisfied with my answers.

At last, we discussed some things related to the company. Overall the interview was quite fun.

## Technical Interview - II

The interviewer asked me for a short intro and then moved to the questions quickly.

- What happens when we type some URL in the browser and hit enter?
- Some cross questions based on my answers.
- Brief discussion on caching and network protocols.
- TCP vs UDP?
- what are stateless protocols?
- is HTTP stateless?

I explained everything in great detail and the interviewer was satisfied with my answers. The questions were aimed to check my knowledge of how the internet works.

Finally he asked me to open any online JavaScript IDE and gave me the following snippet:

```js
new Counter().add(1).add(2).add(3).get() == 6
new Counter().add(1).add(10).reset().add(5).get() == 5
```

The task was to write code for the class `Counter` along with its functions. I was allowed to open docs but only before I start typing.

I was able to complete the task and run the code successfully. The interview was over after this.

Finally 8 students were selected (5 I+FTE and 3 I only) and I was among them. üéâ

## Tips

- (IMP) The JD and mail said that they'll be hiring for "I+J" roles but after the interviews they offered "I+J" to a few candidates only and "I only" to the others. So please be aware of this when you plan for your placements.
- Be confident during your interview and keep talking throughout.
- THINK OUT LOUD! Make sure the interviewer understands your approach.
- Be prepared for every possible question from your resume.

Thanks for reading and feel free to mail/DM me if you want to ask anything. Cheers ü•Ç
