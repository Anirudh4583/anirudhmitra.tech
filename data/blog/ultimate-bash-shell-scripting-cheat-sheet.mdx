# The Ultimate Bash Shell Scripting Cheat Sheet

![cover image](/static/images/blog/bash.png)

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a powerful scripting language used in Unix-like operating systems. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this cheat sheet will serve as a quick reference for bash scripting. Let's dive in!

## 1. Basic Syntax

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is the shebang line, indicating this is a bash script

# Comments start with #
echo "Hello, World!"  # This is an inline comment
```

## 2. Variables

```bash
# Assigning variables (no spaces around =)
name="John Doe"
age=30

# Using variables
echo "My name is $name and I am $age years old."

# Command substitution
current_date=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
echo "Today is $current_date"

# Arithmetic operations
result=$((5 + 3))
echo "5 + 3 = $result"

# Environmental variables
echo "Home directory: $HOME"
echo "Current user: $USER"
```

## 3. User Input

```bash
# Basic input
read -p "Enter your name: " user_name

# Input with a default value
read -p "Enter your age [30]: " age
age=${age:-30}

# Silent input (for passwords)
read -s -p "Enter password: " password
```

## 4. Conditional Statements

```bash
# If-else statement
if [ "$age" -ge 18 ]; then
    echo "You are an adult."
elif [ "$age" -ge 13 ]; then
    echo "You are a teenager."
else
    echo "You are a child."
fi

# Test operators
# -eq (equal), -ne (not equal), -lt (less than), -le (less than or equal)
# -gt (greater than), -ge (greater than or equal)

# File test operators
if [ -f "file.txt" ]; then
    echo "File exists"
fi
if [ -d "/path/to/directory" ]; then
    echo "Directory exists"
fi
# -r (readable), -w (writable), -x (executable), -s (not empty)
```

## 5. Loops

```bash
# For loop
for i in {1..5}; do
    echo "Iteration $i"
done

# While loop
counter=0
while [ $counter -lt 5 ]; do
    echo "Counter: $counter"
    ((counter++))
done

# Until loop
until [ $counter -eq 10 ]; do
    echo "Counter: $counter"
    ((counter++))
done

# Loop over array elements
fruits=("apple" "banana" "orange")
for fruit in "${fruits[@]}"; do
    echo "I like $fruit"
done

# Loop over command output
for file in $(ls); do
    echo "File: $file"
done
```

## 6. Functions

```bash
# Defining a function
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}

# Calling a function
greet "Alice"

# Function with return value
is_even() {
    if [ $(($1 % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
        return 0  # true
    else
        return 1  # false
    fi
}

# Using function return value
if is_even 4; then
    echo "4 is even"
fi
```

## 7. String Manipulation

```bash
string="Hello, World!"
echo "Length: ${#string}"
echo "Uppercase: ${string^^}"
echo "Lowercase: ${string,,}"
echo "Substring: ${string:7:5}"  # World
echo "Replace: ${string/World/Universe}"
```

## 8. Arrays

```bash
# Declaring arrays
declare -a fruits=("apple" "banana" "orange")
numbers=(1 2 3 4 5)

# Accessing elements
echo "Second fruit: ${fruits[1]}"

# Array length
echo "Number of fruits: ${#fruits[@]}"

# Looping through array
for number in "${numbers[@]}"; do
    echo "Number: $number"
done

# Adding elements
fruits+=("grape")

# Removing elements
unset fruits[1]
```

## 9. Case Statement

```bash
case "$1" in
    start)
        echo "Starting the service..."
        ;;
    stop)
        echo "Stopping the service..."
        ;;
    restart)
        echo "Restarting the service..."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac
```

## 10. Error Handling and Debugging

```bash
# Exit on error
set -e

# Print commands before execution
set -x

# Error handling with trap
trap 'echo "Error on line $LINENO"' ERR

# Redirecting errors to a file
command 2> error.log

# Redirecting both stdout and stderr
command &> output.log
```

## 11. Command-line Arguments

```bash
echo "Script name: $0"
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
echo "All arguments: $@"
echo "Number of arguments: $#"
```

## 12. File Operations

```bash
# Reading a file line by line
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "Line: $line"
done < input.txt

# Writing to a file
echo "New content" > output.txt
echo "Appended content" >> output.txt

# Checking file existence
if [ -e "file.txt" ]; then
    echo "File exists"
fi

# Comparing files
if cmp -s "file1.txt" "file2.txt"; then
    echo "Files are identical"
fi
```

## 13. Process Management

```bash
# Running a command in the background
long_running_command &

# Getting the PID of the last background process
bg_pid=$!

# Waiting for a background process to finish
wait $bg_pid

# Killing a process
kill $bg_pid

# Running a command with a timeout
timeout 5s some_command
```

## Conclusion

This cheat sheet covers many aspects of bash shell scripting, from basic syntax to advanced topics like process management. Remember, practice is key to mastering bash scripting. Experiment with these commands and concepts to become proficient in writing powerful and efficient bash scripts.
