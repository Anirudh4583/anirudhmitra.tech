Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. Here's a **very-short** breakdown of the three main categories:

## Creational Patterns

- **Singleton**: One instance, global access.
- **Factory Method**: Interface-driven object creation.
- **Abstract Factory**: Create related objects without specifying concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Step-by-step complex object construction.
- **Prototype**: Clone existing objects.

## Structural Patterns

- **Adapter**: Bridge between incompatible interfaces.
- **Decorator**: Dynamically add behavior to objects.
- **Facade**: Simplify complex systems with a unified interface.
- **Composite**: Tree structures for part-whole hierarchies.
- **Proxy**: Placeholder to control access.
- **Bridge**: Separate abstraction from implementation.
- **Flyweight**: Share common data to save memory.

## Behavioral Patterns

- **Observer**: Notify changes to dependent objects.
- **Strategy**: Swap algorithms dynamically.
- **Command**: Encapsulate requests as objects.
- **State**: Change behavior based on state.
- **Template Method**: Algorithm structure with flexible steps.
- **Mediator**: Simplify object communication.
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Pass requests along a handler chain.
- **Iterator**: Sequentially access collection elements.
- **Visitor**: Add operations without altering object structure.

Knowing when and how to apply these patterns is key to acing your system design interview. Prepare to discuss real-world use cases!
