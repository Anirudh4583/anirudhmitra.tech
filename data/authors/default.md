I'm currently pursuing **Undergraduate in Computer Science** at [Indian Institute of Information Technology Vadodara](http://www.iiitvadodara.ac.in/). I keep looking for great opportunities to contribute towards upcoming technological innovations and create a positive impact on society, alongside my personal and professional development.

My core skills include problem-solving, C/C++ programming ,and developing scalable and maintainable web applications. I'm proficient in React.js, Node.js and well familiar with stacks and technologies like Firebase, Material-UI and many more. Using these I've built a wide range of web applications, ranging from simple to complex, from small to large.

Most of my projects are open source and can be found on My GitHub (link&darr;). Drop me an email if you'd like to collaborate on a project or just want to say hello (I love getting emails, I swear.).

Let's learn and grow together!
